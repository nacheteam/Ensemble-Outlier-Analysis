## Cap√≠tulo 1 An Introduction to Oulier Analysis

### 1.1 Introduction
An outlier or anomaly could be defined as an observation that deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanisim.

The outlier detection can be used in: IDS, credit card fraud detection, interesting sensor events, medical diagnosis, law enforcement or earth science.

The normal data points are usually referred as inliers. In some cases the ouliers are not single points but a sequence or group of points that represents by themselves an anomaly.

When detecting anomalies algorithms can give two types of output: outlier scores that gives a score qualifying the outlierness of each point and binary labels indicating whether a point is an outlier or not.

It is important to make the difference between anomaly and outlier. An outlier refers to a point that can be considered as noise or an abnormality and anomaly refers to a special kind of outlier that is of interest of the analyst.

We could fall on the idea of considering the noise as low scored (weak) outliers and anomaly as high scored (strong) ones, but the real barrier between those two is the interest of the analyst.


Unsupervised detection is the one in which we dont have previous examples and normal data to compare with the new ones and supervised detection is the opposite one.

It is clear that the dimensionality, the type of attributes in the data or the ordering are really important when detecting anomalies and should be taken into account.
