# Outlier Ensemble Analysis

## Summary

This repository contain the implementation of 5 ensemble models: HICS, OUTRES, LODA, Mahalanobis Kernel and Trinity.
These implementations are used to make some experiments for my bachelor degree work. The theoretical description
of the models are taken from the papers and books:

1) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6228154
2) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-015-5521-0

## Structure
The structure of the repository is the following one:

- Datasets: this is the folder with the datasets from ODDS.
- Examples: this folder contains one example of use for each of the models.
- Experiments: this folder contains the two experiments performed on my work as well as the results and the script to generate the figures and results.
- Models: this folder contains the actual implementation of the 5 ensemble models
